# CyberSirens
This project will be a web/mobile educational application for all including people with disabilities.

The application has along way to go but hopefully we will get there. However, you can see a prototype of 
how the final application would approximately look like at: [XSkills Prototype] (https://www.figma.com/proto/2GaIw1xgJQANqF93u3rkFV/XSKILLS%2FNOT_SHARED?type=design&node-id=3-305&t=FuCqZuz0nk7kizrU-1&scaling=scale-down&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=3%3A305&show-proto-sidebar=1&mode=design)

# Steps To Set Up the Frontend
1. Download NodeJs from: https://nodejs.org/en/download (make sure it is added to the path)
2. Clone the repository to your local machine
3. Open the folder in your favorite text editor (mine is VSCode)
4. Open a terminal and run the following few commands below:
```
1. cd frontend
2. npm install
```
5. If you would like to see the project in the browser run the following:
```
  1. cd frontend
  2. npm start
```
This should open up a tab in your browser and you should be able to see the webpage that we have so far. 


# Steps To Set Up the Backend
You can skip steps 2 - 4 if you prefer not using shell environment.
```
  1. cd backend
  2. pip install pipenv
  3. pipenv shell
  4. pipenv install django
```
